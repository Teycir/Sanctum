## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-15

### 🎉 Initial Stable Release

**Sanctum** - Zero-trust encrypted vault system with cryptographic plausible deniability for high-risk users.

### ✨ Features

#### Core Cryptography
- **XChaCha20-Poly1305** authenticated encryption with 256-bit keys
- **Argon2id KDF** with 256MB memory, 3 iterations (brute-force resistant)
- **Split-Key Architecture** - KeyA (URL) + KeyB (encrypted in database)
- **Plausible Deniability** - Hidden layers cryptographically indistinguishable from decoy
- **3-Layer Protection** - Decoy, Hidden, and Panic layers

#### Storage & Infrastructure
- **IPFS Integration** - Pinata and Filebase support with public gateway fallback
- **Cloudflare D1** - Encrypted metadata storage
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Static site hosting with global CDN
- **Provider Isolation** - Separate namespaces prevent cross-contamination
- **Vault ID Integrity** - 16-byte hash prevents cross-vault attacks

#### Security Features
- **RAM-Only Storage** - Zero disk persistence, immune to forensics
- **Auto-Lock** - 5 minutes inactivity timeout
- **Panic Key** - Double-press Escape for instant lockout
- **Randomized Timing** - 500-2000ms delay prevents timing analysis
- **History Clearing** - Vault URL auto-removed from browser history
- **Secure Clipboard** - Auto-clears after 60 seconds
- **Rate Limiting** - 5 attempts/min per vault, 50/hour per fingerprint
- **Fingerprint Tracking** - SHA-256(IP + User-Agent) for abuse detection
- **Honeypot Protection** - Auto-ban on suspicious activity
- **CSRF Protection** - Origin/referer validation
- **Security Headers** - X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, nosniff
- **Input Sanitization** - HTML entity encoding on all user input

#### User Experience
- **File Support** - Upload .zip/.rar archives up to 25MB
- **QR Code Generation** - Easy vault link sharing
- **Vault Expiry** - Configurable auto-deletion (7-365 days)
- **Storage Quota Display** - Real-time Pinata/Filebase usage tracking
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile and desktop support
- **3D Cursor Effects** - Interactive UI animations
- **Security Status Indicator** - Visual display of active protections

#### Developer Experience
- **Next.js 15** - Modern React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety
- **Modular Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 115/115 tests passing (19 test suites)
- **Web Workers** - Isolated crypto operations
- **Web Crypto API** - Native browser cryptography
